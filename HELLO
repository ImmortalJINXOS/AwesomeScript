Hi there! Apologies for the weird communication but you dont seem to have an email address registered in your GH account.
I noticed your account today as I was trying to rename mine since for business purposes I need to use my usual business nickname instead of my personal.  Would you please be willing to give up this account?  Thank you in advance and feel free to email me jinxos@{google.com,linux.com} to discuss.
